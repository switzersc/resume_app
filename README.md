## Description

My resume used to be great, but now it looks like it's got some holes. Find where I'm missing essential bits of code and add them back so I can be a fully functional, hireable app again!

## About

Exercise for TIY RoR class. About 3-5 missing chunks of code. Goal is to figure out where the code is missing and write code to make the app functional again. Aim is to write new code, not to change what's already there.
